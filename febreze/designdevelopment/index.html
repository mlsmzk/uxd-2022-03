While the Americans with Disabilities Act seeks to ensure new buildings and spaces are accessible, many existing establishments remain horribly inaccessible to people with certain disabilities. Currently, the primary way people with mobility restrictions figure out if their needs will be met is by calling places. This can be burdensome and does not guarantee they will get all of the necessary information, if any. Furthermore, the exact needs of each disabled person are complex and nuanced. Our software acts primarily as a database for those with mobility restrictions to get an all-encompassing view of the accessibility desired locations in their area. The app would allow users to filter based on their specific needs (inputted by user with user’s permission), receive recommendations, and view comments and reviews from others with physical disabilities who use the software.</p><h3 id=learning>Learning</h3><p>We tested prototypes of our design with five people with physical disabilities. From these interactive interviews we were able to correct some of our assumptions. First, we assumed that our core task was going to be a recommendation service for people with mobility restrictions. We learned that most people in this community don’t want to have the opportunities to go to new places automatically taken away from them. They would rather have all of the information so they can make an informed decision for themselves. Second, that accessibility could be encompassed with check boxes and star-ratings. While these can still be helpful tools, they are not the full story. We found that accessibility is even more nuanced than we previously thought. Even for an individual, they might decide whether or not they are willing to do something based on how they are feeling or if they are with someone that can assist them. As a result of these interviews, we decided to focus more on the information included for each location/activity which includes: pictures, key accessibility features, and comments (Fig. 1). We also made the decision that including information on accessible routes to a location added too much complexity for the scope of our project.</p><figure class=align-center><img src=/febreze/images/designdevelopment/mapndetail.png alt="Fig.1 - Map with filtered search options and information listed for each location." height=600px><figcaption><p>Fig.1 - Map with filtered search options and information listed for each location.</p></figcaption></figure><p>One element that we have edited and revised multiple times is the method of acquiring user information, which is done primarily to tailor the in-app experience to the user, suggesting only places and activities that match the user’s accessibility needs.</p><p>We needed to find a way to gather the information the first time the user opens the app, but also a way to edit this information later if any accessibility needs were situational or temporary. In order to do the first, we decided to opt for a quiz-style questionnaire that pops up when the user opens the app. An example paper prototype can be seen in the image below (Fig. 2).</p><figure class=align-center><img src=/febreze/images/designdevelopment/paper%20prototypes_Page_2_Image_0001.jpg alt="Fig.2 - One-time questionnaire shown when the user first opens the app." height=600px><figcaption><p>Fig.2 - One-time questionnaire shown when the user first opens the app.</p></figcaption></figure><p>We found that the users we interviewed were less focused on finding things to do and more excited about the information that the app could offer about places they already wanted to go. While we still liked the idea of personalization, we decided to make these preferences editable. Additionally, each time the user searches for a location, they have the option to take any filters off. A prototype with the dedicated accessibility settings page that can be accessed through the profile page is shown below (Fig. 3).</p><figure class=align-center><img src=/febreze/images/designdevelopment/settingsnstuff.png alt="Fig.3 - Profile page (left) and accessibility settings page (right)." height=600px><figcaption><p>Fig.3 - Profile page (left) and accessibility settings page (right).</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=future-work>Future Work</h3><p>For the next phase of our project, we are going to create a polished Figma prototype. From this prototype we hope to answer more questions about the usability of our app, since we have been more focused on the features in this phase.</p></div></section><footer id=footer><ul class=icons></ul><ul class=copyright></ul></footer></div><script src=https://olincollege.github.io/uxd-2022-03/febreze/js/jquery.min.js></script>
